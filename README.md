**Pyon CLI** is a production-ready CLI tool for deploying Solidity and Python smart contracts to Polygon. It features a unique **Python-to-EVM transpiler** that allows you to write smart contracts in Python and deploy them directly to the blockchain.

## 💡 What it does

Pyon CLI is a powerful command-line interface that bridges the gap between Python developers and blockchain smart contract development. It enables developers to:

- Write smart contracts using familiar Python syntax
- Automatically transpile Python code to Solidity/EVM-compatible bytecode
- Deploy contracts to Polygon (Amoy testnet and mainnet)
- Manage wallets securely with encrypted keystores
- Interact with deployed contracts through an intuitive CLI
- Track deployment history and contract interactions

## 🎯 The problem it solves

Smart contract development has traditionally been limited to specialized languages like Solidity, creating a steep learning curve for developers. Pyon CLI solves several critical problems:

- **High Barrier to Entry**: Traditional smart contract development requires learning Solidity, a specialized language with unique syntax and patterns
- **Limited Developer Accessibility**: Python developers, one of the largest programming communities, have been largely excluded from blockchain development
- **Complex Deployment Process**: Deploying contracts typically requires juggling multiple tools, manual ABI management, and complex configuration
- **Wallet Management Complexity**: Secure key management and wallet creation is often cumbersome and error-prone
- **Network Abstraction**: Switching between testnets and mainnet requires understanding RPC endpoints, chain IDs, and network configurations

By allowing developers to write smart contracts in Python and providing a unified CLI for the entire development lifecycle, Pyon CLI dramatically lowers the barrier to blockchain development.

## 🚀 Features

- **Python Smart Contracts**: Write smart contracts in Python and transpile them to EVM bytecode
- **Solidity Support**: Full support for Solidity contract compilation and deployment
- **Multi-Network**: Deploy to Polygon Amoy testnet or mainnet
- **Secure Wallet Management**: Encrypted keystore with PBKDF2 encryption
- **Gas Estimation**: Accurate gas estimation before deployment
- **Rich CLI Interface**: Beautiful command-line interface with progress indicators
- **Deployment Tracking**: Automatic tracking of deployed contracts

## 📦 Installation

### Using pip

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### Using pip with requirements.txt

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

### Development Installation

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## 🔧 Quick Start

### 1. Initialize a New Project

```bash
python -m pyon_cli.cli init my_project
cd my_project
```

This creates a new project with:
- Sample Python and Solidity contracts
- Default configuration file
- Deployment scripts

### 2. Create a Wallet

```bash
python -m pyon_cli.cli wallet new
```

This will:
- Generate a new encrypted wallet
- Save it as `pyon_key.json`
- Display your wallet address

**⚠️ Important**: Fund your wallet with MATIC before deploying contracts!

### 3. Compile Contracts

```bash
python -m pyon_cli.cli compile
```

This compiles both Python and Solidity contracts in the `contracts/` directory.

### 4. Deploy Contracts

```bash
# Deploy to Amoy testnet (default)
python -m pyon_cli.cli deploy SimpleStorage

# Deploy to mainnet
python -m pyon_cli.cli deploy SimpleStorage --network mainnet

# Deploy with constructor arguments
python -m pyon_cli.cli deploy SimpleStorage --args '[42]'

# Dry run (estimate gas only)
python -m pyon_cli.cli deploy SimpleStorage --dry-run
```

## 🐍 Python Smart Contracts

Pyon CLI allows you to write smart contracts in Python using a special syntax:

```python
from pyon_cli.py_contracts import PySmartContract

class SimpleStorage(PySmartContract):
    """Simple storage contract in Python."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.stored_data = self.state_var("stored_data", 0)
    
    @public_function
    def set(self, value: int):
        """Set stored data."""
        self.stored_data = value
        self.event("DataStored", value)
    
    @view_function
    def get(self) -> int:
        """Get stored data."""
        return self.stored_data
```

### Python Contract Features

- **State Variables**: Use `self.state_var(name, initial_value)`
- **Public Functions**: Use `@public_function` decorator
- **View Functions**: Use `@view_function` decorator
- **Events**: Use `self.event(name, *params)`
- **Basic Types**: Support for `int`, `str`, and basic operations

## 📋 CLI Commands

### Project Management

```bash
# Initialize new project
pyon-cli init <project_name> [--force]

# Compile contracts
pyon-cli compile [--contracts contracts/] [--output build/]
```

### Wallet Management

```bash
# Create new wallet
pyon-cli wallet new [--password PASSWORD] [--keystore pyon_key.json]

# Show wallet info
pyon-cli wallet show [--keystore pyon_key.json]
```

### Contract Deployment

```bash
# Deploy contract
pyon-cli deploy <contract_name> [OPTIONS]

# Options:
#   --args TEXT          Constructor arguments as JSON array
#   --config TEXT        Configuration file path
#   --dry-run           Estimate gas without deploying
#   --network TEXT      Override network (amoy/mainnet)
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Network Configuration (`pyon_config.json`)

```json
{
  "network": "amoy",
  "rpc_url": "https://rpc-amoy.polygon.technology",
  "chain_id": 80002,
  "explorer_api_key": ""
}
```

### Supported Networks

| Network | Chain ID | RPC URL |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Amoy (Testnet) | 80002 | https://rpc-amoy.polygon.technology |
| Mainnet | 137 | https://polygon-rpc.com |

## 🔐 Security

### Wallet Security

- Wallets are encrypted using PBKDF2 with SHA-256
- Private keys are never stored in plain text
- Support for environment variable (`PRIVATE_KEY`) for CI/CD

### Best Practices

1. **Never commit private keys** to version control
2. **Use strong passwords** for wallet encryption
3. **Backup your keystore files** securely
4. **Test on Amoy testnet** before mainnet deployment

## 🏗️ How we built it

Pyon CLI was built through a systematic approach focusing on three core components:

### 1. Python-to-Solidity Transpiler
- Designed a custom Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parser to analyze Python smart contract code
- Created mapping rules between Python syntax and Solidity equivalents
- Implemented state variable tracking, function decorators, and event emission translation
- Built type inference system to convert Python types to Solidity types

### 2. CLI Framework
- Developed modular command structure using Click framework
- Implemented wallet management with encrypted keystore support
- Created contract compilation pipeline supporting both .py and .sol files
- Built deployment orchestration with gas estimation and dry-run capabilities

### 3. Blockchain Integration
- Integrated Web3.py for Polygon communication
- Implemented multi-network support (Amoy/Mainnet) with configuration management
- Created transaction signing and broadcasting layer
- Built deployment tracking and contract interaction features

### Development Process
1. **Research Phase**: Studied Solidity semantics and Web3.py capabilities
2. **Prototype**: Built basic transpiler for simple contracts
3. **Iteration**: Enhanced transpiler to support complex DeFi patterns
4. **CLI Development**: Created user-friendly command interface
5. **Testing**: Extensive testing on Amoy testnet with various contract types
6. **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and examples

## 🚧 Challenges I ran into

### 1. Type System Mismatch
**Challenge**: Python's dynamic typing vs Solidity's static typing  
**Solution**: Implemented type inference engine and required type hints for function parameters

### 2. State Management
**Challenge**: Translating Python's object-oriented state to Solidity's storage model  
**Solution**: Created special `state_var()` method to explicitly declare storage variables

### 3. Function Decorators
**Challenge**: Mapping Python decorators to Solidity function modifiers  
**Solution**: Developed custom decorator system (`@public_function`, `@view_function`) that translates to appropriate Solidity visibility

### 4. Gas Optimization
**Challenge**: Ensuring transpiled code is gas-efficient  
**Solution**: Implemented optimization passes in the transpiler and added dry-run mode for gas estimation

### 5. Wallet Security
**Challenge**: Balancing ease of use with secure key management  
**Solution**: Implemented encrypted keystore with PBKDF2 encryption and support for environment variables in CI/CD

### 6. Error Handling
**Challenge**: Providing meaningful error messages across compilation and deployment  
**Solution**: Created comprehensive error handling with rich formatting and actionable suggestions
